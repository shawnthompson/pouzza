The music can be described as extremely catchy pop punk, with sing-a-long hooks, but don't let that fool you–this is a punk band that has you singing along with lyrics about the personal journey of a budding riot grrrl finding her place in today's world. Vocalist, Tonia Broucek, has spent time in the basement/DIY scene in the Midwest, building a fan base with just her ukelele and a message, and has now put together a full band around that message.
